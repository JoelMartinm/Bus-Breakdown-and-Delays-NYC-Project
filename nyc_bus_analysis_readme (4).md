Position additional backup buses and spare vehicles in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens where the highest delay times and incident frequencies occur. Increase maintenance facility capacity and establish satellite maintenance locations in high-incident boroughs to enable faster response times and reduce service disruption duration. Deploy dedicated rapid response teams strategically near the most congestion-prone areas within high-density boroughs, ensuring quick incident resolution. Allocate longer schedule buffers specifically for routes operating in dense urban areas, accounting for the higher probability of traffic delays and the complexity of navigating congested streets. Adjust resource distribution dynamically based on ongoing performance data to ensure the most challenged areas receive appropriate support.

---

### Question 3: Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?

#### Day-of-Week Delay Patterns

![Delay Frequency by Day](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea4d08e-a005-46c4-b9da-4fd9c6c8b885)

**Key Finding**: **Spike in delays on Monday** and a **decrease in delays on Fridays**. Since the majority of delays are caused by traffic, we can assume the decrease in delays on Friday are caused by less people going into work or driving on that day.

**Temporal Pattern**:
- Monday shows highest delay frequency (beginning-of-week traffic surge)
- Gradual decline through the week
- Friday shows notably lower delays (reduced commuter traffic)

**Implications**:
- Monday operations require additional resources and backup buses
- Schedule timing should reflect day-specific traffic patterns
- Friday capacity could potentially be redistributed to higher-demand days

**Recommendations**:

Address the Monday delay spike through enhanced Monday-specific operations and resource allocation. Increase Monday staffing levels across all functions including drivers, maintenance personnel, and dispatch coordinators to handle the elevated demand and incident frequency. Position additional backup vehicles specifically for Monday deployment, ensuring rapid replacement capability when delays or breakdowns occur. Create Monday-specific traffic management coordination with city agencies to anticipate and mitigate the week-start congestion patterns. Build Friday's demonstrated lower delay patterns into capacity planning by potentially redistributing some resources to Monday operations when demand and incident rates are highest, optimizing overall system efficiency across the week.

---

#### Day-of-Week Breakdown Patterns

![Breakdown Frequency by Day](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1de9576b-2080-4cf2-830b-7a61db490a6c)

**Key Finding**: There is a **gradual decrease in breakdowns throughout the week**. Higher percentage of breakdowns happening on Monday and decreases throughout the week.

**Breakdown Trend**:
- Monday experiences highest mechanical breakdown frequency
- Progressive decline from Monday through Friday
- Pattern suggests weekend maintenance effects wear off by week's end

**Implications**:
- Weekend maintenance quality should be reviewed and improved
- Mid-week preventive maintenance could reduce late-week reliability
- Monday vehicle inspections should be particularly thorough

**Recommendations**:

Implement enhanced weekend maintenance quality control to address the root cause of Monday breakdown spikes. Establish comprehensive quality assurance checks on all weekend maintenance work, requiring supervisor sign-offs on completed tasks to ensure accountability and thoroughness. Create mandatory Monday morning verification inspections that specifically check all weekend maintenance work before vehicles enter service, catching any issues before they cause on-route breakdowns. Track weekend maintenance completion rates, quality metrics, and correlation with Monday breakdown incidents to identify problematic patterns or facilities. Schedule strategic mid-week preventive maintenance to address the progressive decline in reliability throughout the week, catching potential issues before they result in Friday breakdowns. Review and enhance weekend maintenance protocols, staffing levels, and supervision to ensure consistent quality that prevents the observed Monday effect. Additionally, implement a real-time performance monitoring system with dashboards tracking breakdowns and delays by day of week, automated alerts when Monday metrics exceed established thresholds, and daily performance reports distributed to all companies, enabling rapid response to emerging patterns and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and accountability across the entire week.
